            <h3 id="lewis">‘Michael is, and always will be, a legend’ – Hamilton 'humbled' to equal Schumacher's win record</h3>
            <p>When Lewis Hamilton crossed the line to win the Eifel Grand Prix he equalled a record many had thought would never be matched – Michael Schumacher’s tally of 91 Formula 1 victories. And after the race the reigning World Champion paid tribute to the former Ferrari star, saying he felt “humbled” to have drawn level with him on wins in motorsport’s top tier.
                “It’s not sunk in, that’s for sure,” said Hamilton after winning the race at the Nurburgring by just over four seconds with Max Verstappen second. The Mercedes driver is, of course, also a massive Ayrton Senna fan, and began by saying that following in the Brazilian’s footsteps was his first target when he started his career.
            </p>
            <p>“Like all of us I grew up watching Michael win all those Grands Prix and I could not even have fathomed equalling him,” he explained. “Getting to Formula 1 was the first step of the dream and emulating Ayrton.
                “Michael was just so far ahead, it’s beyond my wildest dreams to think that I’m here today having equalled him and I just feel really humbled by the moment and the opportunity that I was given when I was 13… and feel really proud to continue to represent and to have brought this record to Mercedes.
            </p>
            </div>
            <p>“I think, hopefully, we’ve got more records to break and make but hopefully they know it was a good investment – hopefully,” he added.
                Now well on his way to equalling another Schumacher record and taking his seventh world championship title, Hamilton stressed just how difficult it is to win at this level – and to stay on top, season after season.
            </p>
            <p>“Naturally everyone knows he [Schumacher] is an icon and a legend of the sport," he said. "I think what he achieved in so many areas, but you know pushing the limits in terms of the physicality side, he really was a pioneer of being the fittest driver at the time and what he did at Ferrari… was just remarkable.
                “And just for me I think that number is so big, and it’s hard for people to perhaps fully understand how hard for him it was to have got those 91 wins, to deliver year on year on year, and stay so in shape and precise – and I understand that now more than ever.
            </p>
            <p>“I can only tell you that It doesn’t get easier from your first win to the 91st, I’m telling you, it’s been a long, hard run and I’ve got great drivers around me who I’m enjoying racing. I hope it’s closer between us [in the future]… but yeah, Michael is, and always will be, a legend.
                “I feel honoured and humbled to have his helmet,” concluded Hamilton, having received a race-worn 2012 Michael Schumacher helmet from the seven-time champion’s son, Mick in an emotional moment at the Nurburgring.

                <h3 id="alonso">Alonso says ‘it’s like a new beginning’ as he gets first taste of 2020 Renault in Barcelona test</h3>
                <p>Fernando Alonso will ramp up his preparations for a sensational return to Formula 1 next season when he tests Renault’s 2020-spec car, the R.S.20, at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya today.
                    The Spanish racer has already begun re-integrating himself into the team with which he won his two F1 world titles – in 2005 and 2006 – and which will be rebranded Alpine next year, spending time at both the Enstone and Viry facilities last month
                </p>
                <p>Alonso – who will replace Daniel Ricciardo and partner Esteban Ocon in 2021 – has also been in constant contact with team personnel, including Team Principal Cyril Abiteboul, regarding the current programme and is following each weekend – and their progress – keenly.
                    He has been pushing to get behind the wheel as soon as possible, but with tight testing restrictions, opportunities are limited.
                </p>
            </div>
                <p>With the team feeling a Free Practice 1 outing wouldn’t be of much use, they have instead opted to use their second filming day, which allows for 100km of running of the current car on promotional Pirelli tyres, to run the Spaniard.
                    The test comes 20 years after his first F1 test with Benetton – a team which Renault have their roots in – at the same circuit.
                </p>
                <p>“Returning behind the wheel is going to be an amazing feeling,” said Alonso, ahead of today’s test, which is being run by Renault’s race – rather than test - team. “After two years not driving in Formula 1, I’m really looking forward to it.
                    “It’s going to be like a new beginning, getting surprised about the speed of the car, the braking performance, the corner speed and a lot of things which will surprise me once again.
                </p>
                <p>It’s very special to be back in Barcelona. I remember my first test with Benetton in the year 2000, it was in Barcelona. It’s going to be at the same circuit 20 years after that first test and it’s going to be one of the last opportunities with a car named after the Renault brand because next year it’s going to change. I feel really privileged, I’m looking forward to it, very excited.
                    “Preparing for this test was not easy,” Alonso added. “With the Covid restrictions, it was not the normal preparations, not many days in the simulator, but nevertheless, I think we are ready. It’s only 100km, it’s a filming day, so we will try to maximise those laps, try to get some images and some filming.
                    “I know I will learn and discover a lot of things during those laps. I will take it with a very open approach, try to learn as much as possible in every kilometre.”

                <h3 id="stroll">Racing Point reveal Stroll hasn't felt well since Russia, but ‘doesn’t have classic COVID symptoms’</h3>
                <p>Lance Stroll will be watching Sunday's Eifel Grand Prix from the sidelines after he and his Racing Point team decided it best not to take part in the race, with the Canadian suffering from an upset stomach and “flu-like symptoms”.
                    Stroll made the call just 30 minutes before FP3 on Saturday, having hoped he could recover in time to drive. Nico Hulkenberg was once again drafted in as a replacement, the German having stood in for Sergio Perez at the Silverstone events after he tested positive.
                </p>
                <p>Stroll was at the track on Thursday and Friday, when practice was cancelled because of the foggy conditions, but has not returned to the track and is believed to be resting and recuperating.
                    It has emerged the Canadian hasn’t felt well for some time – but Racing Point Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer insists multiple PCR Covid-19 tests have come back negative.
                </p>
                <p>“He hasn’t been feeling great since Russia,” said Racing Point Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer. “Since we left Russia, he hasn’t been that great. I think he had a bit of a cold. At first, we 
                    thought he’d better get tested for the virus, but we have tested him multiple times, including the pre-event test for this race, and he has come back negative three or four times.

            <p>“He doesn’t have the classic COVID-19 symptoms, he just doesn’t feel well in himself and last night (Friday night) he had a bit of an upset stomach, so he was on the toilet the whole time, 
                so he said he had lost a lot of fluid and couldn’t get off the toilet for long enough to get in the race car.
            </p>
            <p>“I don’t know if it’s something he ate or a tummy bug or what. He just said he didn’t feel up to it. So I talked to him and said, ‘look, we are going to have a double-header coming up soon’ and I’d rather he rest and get ready for that. So it was close call, we were hoping he would get better.”
                He added: “[He has had] kind of flu-like symptoms. Just not well in himself and couldn’t exercise. So that with maybe something he ate, or a tummy bug, he said he couldn’t do it."
            </p>
            <p>Szafnauer said Stroll was last tested for coronavirus on Tuesday, ahead of the race weekend, with a negative result being returned on Wednesday.
                “We are following the FIA protocol,” he added. “But I think his next was Sunday or Monday. I think it’s five days and you get another test. I think it’s the same for all of us.”
                Stroll is being monitored by doctors and Szafnauer says when the Canadian feels well enough to leave the room, he’ll fly home.
                He now has 11 days to rest before needing to fly out to Portugal for the upcoming back-to-back races with Imola.

                <h3>Abiteboul: Ricciardo played key role in Renault's F1 progress</h3>
                <p>Renault Formula 1 boss Cyril Abiteboul believes Daniel Ricciardo's podium at the Eifel Grand Prix reflects the positive contribution he has made to the team since he joined last season.
                    With Ricciardo securing the Enstone team's first podium finish for five years with his charge to third place last weekend at the Nurburgring, Abiteboul also felt the result answered critics who have suggested that it was a mistake for the two parties to team up.
                    He also stressed the value of logging a podium together before they part company at the end of this season, when Ricciardo moves to McLaren, while Renault welcomes back Fernando Alonso in 2021.
                </p>
                <p>"It's equally important to the team, to Daniel, to myself also," said Abiteboul. "We've been questioned about this decision of him joining us and also his decision of joining the team. So in both directions, really.
                    "I think it was very important for everyone to put the commentators at bay and show why it made sense at the time. Yes, it was disappointing last year, you could argue that it was one year too early.
                    "But you know, there are not that many opportunities to have a driver like Daniel, who was available on the market. So I still believe that it was the right thing to do at the time."
                </p>
            </div>
                <p>Abiteboul said that a below par 2019 season and a push from proven race-winner Ricciardo has helped to move the team forward.
                    "The team wouldn't be what it is today without Daniel, despite and maybe thanks also to the year that we had together last year, which was indeed a very painful year" he said.
                    "Which has pushed all of us, probably starting with myself, to take the measures that we've taken, and also with the team in Enstone with Marcin Budkowski and so on and so forth.
                    "So now we are finding ourselves in a much better position for this year and for next year, and Daniel is capable of doing this type of thing. I think it's a statement.
                </p>
                <p>Abiteboul also referenced his own frustrated reaction after Ricciardo revealed in May that he was leaving to join McLaren in 2021.
                    The team boss commented about "reciprocated confidence, unity and commitment", hinting that the Australian had not kept his side of the bargain.
                    "I know that our communication was a bit negative when we found out that he would not stay with the team at the time," said Abiteboul.
                    "But I think that it's precisely because it was an honest, emotional, unfiltered communication at the time that Daniel is also being unfiltered and genuine in what he's doing today for the team."
