                <p>Mans victory in the French MotoGP for the first time Sunday, while Spaniard Alex Marquez finished second for his first podium in the absence of his illustrious older brother.

                    Spain’s Pol Espargaro finished third while championship leader Fabio Quartararo placed ninth, but the Frenchman extended his lead over Spaniard Joan Mir to 10 points.
                    
                    Six-time world champion Marc Marquez, who had won the past two editions, is not competing against his sibling since fracturing his right arm in the season-opening race.
                </p>
                <p>The 24-year-old Alex started from 18th and the Honda rider made huge gains late on.

                    But he ran out of time and finished 1.27 seconds behind the Ducati of Petrucci, who mastered the soaking wet conditions well on a drenched Le Mans track for a second career win. Petrucci became the first Ducati rider to win at Le Mans.
                    
                    Espargaro was 1.71 seconds behind for KTM.
                    
                    Quartararo started from pole position for the third time this season, starting ahead of Ducati’s Jack Miller and Petrucci.
                    
                    But after five laps Quartararo dropped down to 11th on a miserable day for Yamaha, which saw seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi crash on Lap 1 of 26.
                </p>
            </div>
                <p>The Italian veteran was chasing a 200th career podium but his race ended on Turn 3 when he went down.

                    Fortunately for Quartararo, the Suzuki of Mir was even further back in 17th after starting from 14th.
                    
                    With 10 laps remaining, Italian rider Andrea Dovizioso led from Petrucci and Miller in a Ducati 1-2-3.
                    
                    Then Alex Rins made a big push and got into second place, but the Spaniard pushed his Suzuki too hard and went off his bike with seven laps remaining. His crash also caused Miller to fall, and the Australian was visibly angry when he got back to the team garage.
                    
                    Dovizioso finished in fourth spot and Mir was 11th.
                    
                    British riders Cal Crutchlow and Bradley Smith; Spaniard Tito Rabat and Italian Franco Morbidelli also crashed on a track that stayed slippery throughout.

            <h3 id="joe robert">Roberts signs with Italtrans Racing Team for Moto2 in 2021</h3>
            <p>American Joe Roberts will move to the Italtrans Racing Team for the 2021 Moto2™ World Championship. The Californian announced he would be leaving the Tennor American Racing team on Friday afternoon before official confirmation came out later that day that we would be replacing Enea Bastianini in the Italtrans squad, with the Italian moving up to the premier class.

                It's been a breakout year for the 23-year-old in 2020 as he announced himself as a regular front runner in the intermediate class. He stole headlines in Qatar at the start of the year with a debut pole position before doing it once more in Brno, as he clinched a career-first Grand Prix podium. Just last weekend in Le Mans, he became the first American since Nicky Hayden in 2005 to bag three pole positions in a season.
            </p>
            <p>His exit from the American Racing team all-but confirms the much-rumoured arrival of five-time MotoAmerica Superbike Champion Cameron Beaubier, who looks set to return to Grand Prix racing for the first time since 2009. Roberts will retain his ties with former MotoGP™ rider John Hopkins in 2021 despite his move to Italtrans Racing.
            </p>
            </div>
            <p>Joe Roberts: "I am super excited to be joining the Italtrans Racing Team for the 2021 Moto2 season! I look forward to working with legendary technician Giovanni Sandi and learning everything I can from him, and all of the other high-level technical staff in the team. We have one goal, to win and be a championship contender.

                "I’d like to thank everyone at Italtrans for the opportunity to take this important next step in my career with them. For the five remaining rounds of 2020, I will be focused 100% with my guys at the American Racing Team. My job is not done there yet and we will continue to work toward podiums and our first win."
            </p>
            
            <div class="col-md-6 mt-5 text-justify">
            <h3 id="enea bastianini">Moto2 frontrunner Enea Bastianini has confirmed he for Ducati MotoGP 2021</h3>
            <p>Bastianini is currently eight points off the championship lead in Moto2 in just his second season in the intermediate class, and has been linked to a MotoGP step since Andrea Dovizioso’s factory Ducati departure was confirmed last month.</p>
            <p>It has long been thought Bastianini would join the Avintia squad, which became an official Ducati satellite team for 2019 with the arrival of Johann Zarco. The latter will now either join Pramac in place of Francesco Bagnaia, or be moved directly to the factory squad to replace Dovizioso, while Bagnaia stays at Pramac with full factory support.

                During the MotoGP world feed broadcast of FP2, Avintia boss Ruben Xaus confirmed Zarco will be leaving the team at the end of the year and is “99 percent” sure Bastianini will take his place.
                
                “It’s clear that we were looking to upgrade the situation of the team,” said Xaus. “Things are happening very fast. I thought it was going to be in two years, but suddenly were moving correctly and we got a quicker situation, and in just one year we step up.</p>

                </figure>
            </div>
                <p>“It’s clear for next year that Johann is not going to be with us, I’m very happy for him because he deserves to be on a factory bike with Ducati and it’s clear that for us we have a good spot for the young generation to come up and show good things. We have proved we can really be fast on track, and I’m sure that a young Italian will come in.

                    “I am 99 percent [sure] that Bastianini will join us next year.”</p>
                <p>Bastianini has since confirmed the signing of his Ducati deal, though doesn’t know yet where he will be placed.

                    “Yeah, I have signed for Ducati,” he revealed. “At the moment I don’t know the team, but I think in the next week – or I don’t know – it will be possible to confirm this.
                    
                    “For me it’s really important to be the next year with Ducati, it’s a good family for me, it’s an Italian bike. I think [it will] be possible to be fast in MotoGP, but we will see.”
                    
                    Ducati said last month that it would take a decision on its full 2021 line-up ahead of the Misano double-header.
                    
                    KTM Moto2 rider Jorge Martin – who has been ruled out of the San Marino GP due to COVID-19 – is set to join Pramac, while current Moto2 points leader and Valentino Rossi’s half-brother Luca Marini has been linked to a Ducati ride.
                    
                    Current Avintia rider Tito Rabat is looking less likely to remain in that spot for 2021, with Marini a likely option to replace him.

                <p>Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP and Yamaha Motor Racing Managing Director Lin Jarvis have given an update on Valentino Rossi’s positive COVID-19 result, detailing the chronological order of events that led to the positive PCR test on Thursday afternoon in Aragon.
                </p>
                <p>On Sunday 11th October, Rossi left the Le Mans circuit and travelled back to his home in Tavullia, Italy.
                    On Tuesday 13th October, Rossi underwent the usual PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test, which is compulsory for those who visit their homes in between races. The result was available the next day and it was negative.
                    On Wednesday 14th October, Rossi was feeling fully fit and he trained at home without any symptoms or inconveniences.
                    On Thursday 15th October, he woke up in the morning and felt a bit sore. He had a slight fever and immediately called a doctor. The doctor conducted two tests:
                    First, a ’quick PCR test‘, that again came back with a negative test result.
                    Then, a standard PCR test, of which the result arrived on Thursday 15th October, at 16:00 local time. Unfortunately this result was positive.
                </p>
                </div>
                <p>During Rossi‘s stay at his home from Sunday night (11th October) to today (15th October), he has NOT been in contact with any person that is currently present at the Gran Premio de Aragon, including VR46 Academy riders, VR46 staff, Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP team members etc.
                    Rossi's condition will be closely monitored by the medical staff in Tavullia.
                    The situation will be reviewed every day with a view to Rossi's participation at the upcoming MotoGP™ race events. 
                </p>
                <p>Lin Jarvis: “This is very bad news for Valentino and very bad news for the Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP team and for all MotoGP fans around the world. First and foremost we hope Valentino will not suffer too much in the coming days and will recover fully in the shortest time possible. It comes as a second blow for our MotoGP operations having faced the absence of Project Leader Sumi-san and five YMC engineers at the Le Mans race after one member tested positive – despite being fortunately totally asymptomatic.
                    “These two incidents remind us that no matter how careful you are, the risk is always present - as we see with the rising numbers of infections in Europe at this time. We have checked with the Italian health authorities and we have been advised that any member of our team that was in contact with Valentino up until Monday is excluded from direct risk. Nevertheless, we will be even more attentive from now on to minimise the chance for any future issues.”
